# Miscellaneous

This repo serves as a place for me to put things I've made or collected that might be helpful to others, such as scripts, documents or guides.

There's not much at present apart from a guide on [Debugging Mobile Safari 11 on Linux](docs/ios-debugging.md), but there'll be more as I import stuff from other places.
